# Neovim Configuration Analysis

## Project Overview

This directory contains a personal Neovim configuration based on the [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) distribution. It uses the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager to handle plugins and their configurations.

The configuration is structured in Lua, with the main entry point being `init.lua`. The base configuration and plugins are managed in `lua/config/lazy.lua`.

Key features of this configuration include:

*   **Plugin Manager**: `lazy.nvim` is used for managing plugins.
*   **Color Scheme**: The `onedark` color scheme is used for styling the editor.
*   **Status Line**: `lualine.nvim` provides a customized status line.
*   **Language Support**: There is specific configuration for the Go programming language, including `gopls` settings.
*   **Customization**: The `lua/plugins` directory contains custom plugin configurations, and `lua/config` holds core editor settings.

## Building and Running

This is a Neovim configuration, so there is no "build" process. To "run" this configuration, you need to:

1.  **Install Neovim** (version 0.9 or higher).
2.  **Clone this repository** into your Neovim configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/nvim`).
3.  **Start Neovim**:
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
On the first launch, `lazy.nvim` will automatically install all the configured plugins.

## Development Conventions

*   **Plugin Management**: Plugins are defined as specifications in files within the `lua/plugins/` directory. `lazy.nvim` automatically loads them.
*   **Configuration**:
    *   Core Neovim settings are in `lua/config/options.lua`.
    *   Keymaps are defined in `lua/config/keymaps.lua`.
    *   Autocommands are in `lua/config/autocmds.lua`.
*   **Plugin Customization**: To customize a plugin, you can modify its corresponding file in `lua/plugins/`. For example, `lua/plugins/go.lua` contains settings for Go development.
*   **Formatting**: The presence of a `stylua.toml` file suggests that `stylua` is used to format Lua code in this project.
*   **Dependencies**: The `lazy-lock.json` file locks the versions of the plugins, ensuring a reproducible setup.
